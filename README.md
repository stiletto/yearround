# yearround
Yearround is a circular calendar, implemented in JavaScript using HTML5 canvas element.

It was created just because I wanted to see how such a calendar would look like.
Color scheme was inspired by https://drive.google.com/previewtemplate?id=1Cyg3kqR3Gd0hdTv_N7s2khX4Z9l5wQoVnRK6L-zI7pY&mode=public#

If you are a Firefox user, it will take advantage of Date().toLocaleFormat() to translate month and day names.
